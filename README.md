# gow-collector

Basic sketch for the gowdock app, which will include in the first place the collector's app. 

Model added at Collector.js;

Controllers Create, Update, Delete and Session are already available;

Used Bcrypt for hashes of passwords;

Used JWT for auth on needed endpoints;

Still working on some other features as avatar for login and the docker config files for future use.
